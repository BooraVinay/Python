# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict whether a person survived or not on the Titanic using machine learning. It utilizes the RandomForestClassifier from scikit-learn to build a classification model.

## Files
- `Titanic Classification.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: Documentation providing an overview of the project and instructions.

## Dependencies
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
- pandas
- scikit-learn

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Open the `Titanic Classification.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment.
2. Run each cell sequentially to execute the code.
3. The notebook will output the accuracy of the trained model on the test set.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model is the Titanic dataset, available at [this URL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/master/titanic.csv). The dataset contains information about passengers, including whether they survived, age, gender, etc.

## Model
The classification model used is a RandomForestClassifier from scikit-learn with 100 trees and a random state for reproducibility.
